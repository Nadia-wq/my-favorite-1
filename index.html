                Hi, I'm Nadia. Im 12 years old and my hobby is watching TV. I mostly watch Netflix because there are very good shows to watch there. 
                My favorite netflix show is Stranger things Starring millie bobby brown, finn wolfhard, caleb mcglauclin, gaten matarazo, noah schnapp, sadie sink, winona ryder, david harbour, charlie heaton, natlia dyer, joe keery.
                There are also other shows like alexa and katie, no good nick, 13 reasons why, im not okay with this..etc...
                There are more shows that aren't produced by netflix like Brooklyn 99, Naruto..etc...
                I watch Netflix everyday and even you should because it is a stress reliever.
            </p>
